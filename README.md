# Naive Bayes Classifier Project

To run the Naive Bayes algorithm, these are the functions we need to call in order:
- preprocess(train_file)
- train(train_file)
- prediction(test_file)

## Preprocess Function

The function will preprocess the input data by converting string values to float, replacing all missing values with NaN. To run the preprocess function, we get a csv file containing the train and test data as an input, such as:
```python
train_file = preprocess(‘train.csv’)
test_file = preprocess(‘test.csv’)
```

## Train Function

This function returns the mean, standard deviation based on each feature and using those values to find prior probabilities and likelihood of training data. To run this function, we need input of a train csv file.

```python
mean_list, sd_list, d_prior, keys_list = train(train_file)
```

## Test Function

This function predicts our test set by imputing the mean , standard deviation from the train set that we has calculated before in the train function and using the Gaussian naive bayes to calculate the prior probability and the likelihood.This function will return the class label based on the highest probability that we calculate from the sum of each instance.

```python
prediction = predict(test_file.iloc[:,1:], mean_list, sd_list, d_prior, keys_list)
```

## Evaluate Function

This function will return to the accuracy, precision, recall, F score by comparing the prediction results and ground truth from the test file.
```python
evaluate(prediction, test_file.iloc[:,0])
```
